Stochastic optimization is a classic approach for solving unconstrained optimization problems
under uncertainty. Unconstrained optimization problems can be formulated as optimization
problems with uncertain parameters. In this report we will explore some classic approaches and
some recent methods, that are widely used in big data community. We will also make some
experiments on different datasets.
